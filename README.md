# Voter Turnout Analysis Project


### Project Description


This project involves analyzing voter registration and participation patterns using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration Supplement and the Cooperative Election Study (CES) 2020 extract. The objective is to understand the factors influencing voter turnout and registration, particularly focusing on the discrepancies between different age groups and the self-reported versus validated voting behavior.

### Objective


The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. Identify the key variables that determine if an individual voted or was registered to vote.
2. Calculate the percentage of adults and adult citizens who voted in the 2020 election.
3. Analyze how voter turnout varies by age.
4. Examine discrepancies between self-reported voting behavior and validated voting data.
5. Calculate different measures of voter turnout.
6. Provide recommendations to an organization aiming to increase voter turnout among younger voters based on the analysis.



### Summary of Results


Step 1: Identifying Voter Registration and Participation


• Combined variables from the CPS to create a new variable representing registered voters accurately.

• Verified consistency in responses to exclude logically inconsistent data.


Step 2: Calculating Voter Participation Percentages


Used the weight variable to calculate the percentage of all adults and adult citizens who voted in the 2020 election.
Compared results with the Census Bureau's summary document table04c.xlsx.


Step 3: Calculating Voter Registration Percentages


Calculated the percentages of all adults and adult citizens who were registered to vote.
Confirmed results with the Census Bureau's summary document.


Task 4: Analyzing Voter Turnout by Age
Produced a graph showing voter turnout variation across different age groups.
Found that younger voters had lower turnout compared to older voters.
Task 5: Creating a Binary Voting Variable
Created a binary variable indicating whether individuals reported voting in 2020.
Calculated the percentage of individuals who reported voting.
Task 6: Comparing Reported Voting to Validated Voting
Compared self-reported voting data to validated voter file data.
Identified discrepancies between self-reported voting and validated voting behavior.
Task 7: Calculating Turnout Measures
Calculated three different measures of voter turnout.
Examined the differences in turnout rates based on various methodologies.
Task 8: North Carolina Voter Analysis
Analyzed North Carolina State Board of Elections data to calculate the total number of voters in the 2020 election.
Calculated turnout using the Citizen Voting Age Population from the 2020 American Community Survey.
Task 9: Comparing Turnout Rates Across Surveys
Compared voter turnout rates in North Carolina from the voter file, CPS, and CES.
Found higher turnout rates in academic surveys like the CES compared to official records.
Task 10: Recommendations for Increasing Voter Turnout Among Younger Voters
Identified that younger voters often cited 'lack of interest' or 'feeling of insignificance' as reasons for not voting.
Recommended strategies such as increasing accessibility, running awareness campaigns, simplifying registration, and engaging with technology to increase voter turnout among younger voters.
Main Analysis
